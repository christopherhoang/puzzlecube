        <h2>Project Design Criteria & Requirements</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="lt">Material:</li>
            <p>The puzzle must be constructed entirely from 27 individual ¾-inch wooden cubes.</p>
            <li class="lt">Number of Pieces:</li>
            <p>The puzzle should consist of exactly five distinct puzzle pieces.</p>
            <li class="lt">Piece Composition:</li>
            <p>Each individual puzzle piece must be comprised of precisely four to six of the ¾-inch wooden cubes.</p>
            <li class="lt">Three-Dimensional Structure:</li>
            <p>All puzzle pieces must be three-dimensional (3D), meaning they must have a minimum size of two cubes
                along each
                axis (x, y, and z).</p>
            <li class="lt">Unique Designs:</li>
            <p>No two puzzle pieces should be identical in design or layout. Each piece should be visually and
                structurally
                distinct.</p>
            <li class="lt">Final Assembly:</li>
            <p>When correctly assembled, the five puzzle pieces must combine to form a perfect 2 ¼-inch cube, which
                translates
                to a 3x3x3 configuration using individual cubes.</p>
            <li class="lt">Interlocking Challenge:</li>
            <p>To enhance the complexity, some puzzle pieces should incorporate interlocking mechanisms that could
                initially
                mislead or confuse users attempting to solve the puzzle.</p>

        <h2>Design Choice Justification</h2>
        <br>
        <div id="choicejust">
            <ul>
                <li>Classmates found design #2 harder to solve based on sketches.</li>
                <li>Targeting ages 3+, the puzzle needs to be easy as possible to solve</li>
                <li>Design #1 uses simpler pieces for easier solving.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            Through classmate feedback, design #2 emerged as the more challenging option based on sketches alone.
            As the target audience is ages 3 and above, the puzzle needs to be manageable for toddlers.
            Therefore, design #1, with its simpler pieces, is the clear winner for ease of use.

        <h3>Calculating Tolerance for Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
            Before creating a prototype with a 3D printer using PLA or PETG filament,
            we need to account for extra material extruded during printing.
            Due to this, a 0.01mm tolerance was incorporated into the models created
            in Solidworks to ensure proper fit for printing
            on a MakerBot Sketch 3D printer.

        <h2>Making Sense of Puzzle Test Data</h2>
        <h3>Linear Forcast Line: y = -0.0554(x) + 3.7122</h3>
        <p>
            The testing results allowed me to create a scatterplot and identify the forcast trendline.
            This trendline allows me to calculate, or predict, a future value by using existing values.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Variable x:</span> This represents the number of attempts made to
                complete the task.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Variable y:</span> This represents the predicted time to complete a
                task in minutes.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Slope of -0.0554:</span> Predicted time reduces by 0.0554 minutes per
                attempt.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.7122:</span> This is the y-intercept, represents the predicted time
                when there have been zero attempts</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Estimation, Prediction and Forecasting</h3>

        <h2>Exploring Improvement Ideas</h2>
        <h3>Simplfy the Design</h3>
        <p>
            While my data shows solving time is improving, the puzzle might still be too challenging for young children.
            Most testers were adults (youngest was 11). I may need to consider a wider range of ages in future tests.
            Involving younger testers is important, but finding them can be a challenge!
        </p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <div class="sections">
        <h2>Conclusion Questions</h2>
        <h3>
            1. Why is it important to model an idea before making a final prototype?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Modeling an idea first may help discover any flaws or weaknesses, explore different options, and
            communicate your thoughts effectively.
            The result is a smoother design process and a better final product.
        </p>
        <h3>
            2. Which assembly constraint(s) did you use to constrain the parts of the puzzle to
            the assembly such that it did not move?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Solidworks' Mate constraint is what I used when assembling my puzzle cube prototype.
            It restricts movement between puzzle piece faces on all three axes (x, y, and z).
            This essentially locked each piece in place, requiring the Mate constraint to be
            applied three times per piece for a complete cube assembly.
        </p>
        <h3>
            3. Based on your experiences during the completion of the Puzzle Design
            Challenge, what is meant when someone says, “I used a design process to solve
            the problem at hand”? Explain your answer using examples from the work that
            you completed.
        </h3>

            The Puzzle Design Challenge allowed me to put the 6-stage design process I learned in class into action.
            Following this structured approach, I developed and improved my puzzle cube idea.

            <p> This meant understanding the problem.
                The creation of the puzzle cube originated from solving a waste problem of a furniture company which
                had specific requirement criteria I had to follow, like age demographic of 3+,
                overall size of the cube, exactly 5 puzzle parts, etc.

                While this was a solo project, collaboration played a role. I sought feedback on my puzzle piece
                sketches
                from classmates,
                asking which design they thought offered the most challenge. I also provided input on their designs in
                return.

            <li id="lt">Research</li>
            <p>
                By analyzing existing puzzle cube designs, parts, and difficulty levels online, I gained valuable
                insights
                into how people approach solving puzzles.
                These ideas then helped me refine my own puzzle pieces.

                Using 3D printers, I brought my puzzle cube design to life, transforming notebook sketches and
                SolidWorks
                models into a physical prototype for testing.
            </p>
            <li id="lt">Test</li>
            <p>
                I found some classmates and volunteers from Evergreen Valley College to participate in a "time to
                complete"
                experiment with my 3D-printed puzzle prototype.
            </p>
            <li id="lt">Record</li>
            <p>
                By carefully recording test results, I could analyze the data and make predictions. This allowed me to
                assess the difficulty of
                my puzzle cube design, estimating the number of attempts needed to solve it within a specific time
                frame.

            Saying "I used a design process" means tackling a problem in a logical, step-by-step way.
            This involves exploring ideas and refining them based on what works and what doesn't until you reach a
            solution.
