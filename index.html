        <h2>Puzzle Design Challenge Brief</h2>
        <h3>Challenge:</h3>
        <p>Fine Office Furniture Inc. generates a significant amount of ¾” scrap hardwood cubes as a byproduct of their
            furniture manufacturing. This waste is not only a sustainability concern but also represents lost profit due
            to the valuable material.</p>
        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>Design and develop a captivating 3D puzzle system made entirely from these scrap hardwood cubes. This system
            should not only be a fun and engaging desktop novelty item but also serve as a way to showcase the beauty
            and quality of the company's wood.</p>
        <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
        <p>The puzzle system should be accessible to a broad audience, with a difficulty level suitable for ages 3 and
            above. This means the design needs to be visually appealing, intuitive, and offer a satisfying sense of
            accomplishment upon completion.</p>
        <h3>Design Considerations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="lt">Functionality:</li>
                <p>The puzzle system should be challenging yet solvable
                    within a reasonable timeframe. Consider incorporating spatial reasoning, manipulation skills, and color
                    recognition into the puzzle design.</p>
                <li class="lt">Aesthetics:</li>
                <p>Leverage the natural beauty of the wood. Explore options
                    like staining or painting specific cubes to enhance the visual appeal.</p>
                <li class="lt">Sustainability:</li>
                <p>Ensure the design minimizes waste and utilizes all
                    available scrap wood cubes effectively.</p>
                <li class="lt">Production:</li>
                <p>Develop a design that can be efficiently produced using
                    the available scrap wood and minimal additional materials.</p>
                <li class="lt">Marketing Potential:</li>
                <p>The puzzle system should act as a conversation
                    starter, highlighting Fine Office Furniture's commitment to sustainability and high-quality materials.</p>
            </ul>
        <h3>Deliverables:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Detailed sketches or 3D models of the puzzle system design.</li>
                <li>Prototype of the puzzle system.</li>
                <li>Instructions for assembly and solution.</li>
            </ol>
       
        <h3>Success Criteria:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Engaging and provides a satisfying challenge for ages 3+.</li>
            <li>Effectively utilizes scrap wood cubes, minimizing waste.</li>
            <li>Showcases the quality and beauty of the company's wood.</li>
            <li>Safe, aesthetically pleasing, and cost-effective to produce.</li>
         </ul>

        <h2>Project Design Criteria & Requirements</h2>
            <ol>
                <li class="lt">Material:</li>
                <p>The puzzle must be constructed entirely from 27 individual ¾-inch wooden cubes.</p>
                <li class="lt">Number of Pieces:</li>
                <p>The puzzle should consist of exactly five distinct puzzle pieces.</p>
                <li class="lt">Piece Composition:</li>
                <p>Each individual puzzle piece must be comprised of precisely four to six of the ¾-inch wooden cubes.</p>
                <li class="lt">Three-Dimensional Structure:</li>
                <p>All puzzle pieces must be three-dimensional (3D), meaning they must have a minimum size of two cubes along each
                    axis (x, y, and z).</p>
                <li class="lt">Unique Designs:</li>
                <p>No two puzzle pieces should be identical in design or layout. Each piece should be visually and structurally
                    distinct.</p>
                <li class="lt">Final Assembly:</li>
                <p>When correctly assembled, the five puzzle pieces must combine to form a perfect 2 ¼-inch cube, which translates
                    to a 3x3x3 configuration using individual cubes.</p>
                <li class="lt">Interlocking Challenge:</li>
                <p>To enhance the complexity, some puzzle pieces should incorporate interlocking mechanisms that could initially
                    mislead or confuse users attempting to solve the puzzle.</p>
            </ol>

        <h2>Design Choice Justification</h2>
        <br>
        <div id="choicejust">
            <ul>
                <li>Classmates found design #2 harder to solve based on sketches.</li>
                <li>Targeting ages 3+, the puzzle needs to be easy as possible to solve</li>
                <li>Design #1 uses simpler pieces for easier solving.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            Through classmate feedback, design #2 emerged as the more challenging option based on sketches alone.  
            As the target audience is ages 3 and above, the puzzle needs to be manageable for toddlers.  
            Therefore, design #1, with its simpler pieces, is the clear winner for ease of use.

        <h3>Calculating Tolerance for Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
            Before creating a prototype with a 3D printer using PLA or PETG filament, 
            we need to account for extra material extruded during printing. 
            Due to this, a 0.01mm tolerance was incorporated into the models created 
            in Solidworks to ensure proper fit for printing 
            on a MakerBot Sketch 3D printer.
